# Only ones

The constant sequence 

```
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,...
```

appears in OEIS with number ``A000012``. Two things come to my mind. First, I'd like to think that I would have the capacity to identify that sequence without help from OEIS, should it ever come up in my research. Second, surely it must have one of the most boring descriptions in the whole database? And here is where I underestimated the creativity of the OEIS contributors. 

Because according to OEIS, ``A000012(n)`` is, among other things:

* the smallest divisor of *n*.
* the number of complete graphs on *n* nodes.
* the number of empty graphs on *n* nodes.
* the number of prime factorizations of *n* up to order of factors (this is actually quite a fundamental theorem).
* the number of ways to write *n* as a sum of distinct powers of 2.
* the number of maximal self-avoiding walks from upper-left to lower-left corner on a ``2 x n`` grid (wow!).
* the product of non-zero digits in base-2 representation of *n* (wat?).

Moreover, the full sequence is:

* the continued fraction expansion of the golden ratio.
* decimal expansion of ``1/9``.
* differences between consecutive integers.

Do you have any other exciting definitions? How about

* the reduced Betti number of the *n*-sphere
