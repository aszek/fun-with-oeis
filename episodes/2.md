# Houston, we have a problem

Last time we looked at the sequence number 1 in [OEIS](https://oeis.org), which turns out to be the number of isomorphism classes of groups of cardinality n. But many sequences in OEIS can be appreciated with much less specialized knowledge. For example

```
11,12,14,15,16,17
```

is a subsequence that appears in many sequences, of which my favorite are ``A001690`` *Non-Fibonacci numbers* and (weird but somewhat hilarious) ``A247755`` *Numbers in decimal representation, such that in German their digits are in alphabetic order.*

But there is one sequence in OEIS that reads simply 

```
11,12,14,15,16,17.
```

That is the whole sequence. Finite, six terms. Can you guess its description?
