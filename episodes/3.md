# Russell's paradox

Last time we had a look at the very short sequence ``A247849`` - numbers of Apollo missions that landed people on the moon. There is more history in OEIS, some of it as creepy as *Years when a President of the USA died in office* or *Number appearing in the full name of the n-th Pope* (``A113515``). I'm not sure how that serves the purpose of OEIS, which is to help people recognize sequences which appear in their research...

But now for some completely different. I expected someone would come up with the idea of self-referencing sequences and voila! There is even an [OEIS version of Russell's paradox](http://oeis.org/A053169).
