# Only two terms and Carmichael's theorem

What is the shortest sequence in OEIS? Actually, there are a few sequences with only one term and around 40 of length 2. Mostly because nobody was bothered to compute the third term, or it has unpractically many digits. Those sequences are mostly extremely artificial. With at least one exception...

``A235383`` is the two-term sequence

```
8, 144
```

defined as *Fibonacci numbers that are the product of other Fibonacci numbers*. These are the only ones! This is an incarnation of an interesting theorem of Carmichael from 1913, stating that every term of the Fibonacci sequence **except** for those two is divisible by a *new* prime, that is a prime which does not divide any previous term.

Actually, the theorem applies to a wider range of Lucas-like sequences defined by a second-order recurrence. Check out [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmichael%27s_theorem). And yes, it is the same Carmichael featured in the Carmichael function and in Carmichael pseudo-primes which fool Fermat's primality test.

Quite a story behind a two-term sequence. Now, who dares explain something about the equally short ``A179128``?
