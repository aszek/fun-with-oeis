# Uendelighedsrækken

Per Nørgård (b. 1932) is a Danish contemporary classical music composer, known for using infinite sequences as an inspiration for his pieces. In fact he was particularly fond of one specific infinite sequence (Uendelighedsrækken) of his own design. It starts with

```
0, 1, -1, 2, 1, 0, -2, 3, -1, 2, 0, 1, 2, -1, -3, 4
```

and is defined by the recursive formula

```
s(0) = 0
s(n) = - s(n/2)        for n even
s(n) = s((n-1)/2) + 1  for n odd.
```

Nørgård discovered and started using this sequence in the 1960s to give his compositions a feel of self-similarity and endless, but not periodic, repetition. The sequence denotes the offsets (half-steps) away from a starting note, positive/negative values corresponding to higher/lower pitch. One of the most prominent compositions featuring this sequence is the 2nd movement of *Voyage into the Golden Screen* (1968). You can listen to it here:

If you are not a connoisseur of contemporary classical music, here is a more down-to-earth rendition of the sequence:

Nice mathematical properties of Nørgård's sequence are studied in the next paper by Shallit and Drexler-Lemire. In particular, they show how to compute the value of s(n) by traversing the binary representation of n.

It remains to say that Nørgård's sequence has number ``A004718`` in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, and this was episode 8 of Fun with OEIS (http://oeis.org).
