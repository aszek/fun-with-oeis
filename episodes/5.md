# Which Polish city?

In the OEIS search box you can enter not just numbers, but also text, for example a single word. That will produce a full-text search in descriptions, comments, names of contributors, references, e-mails, basically the full content of the database.

For example, ``Warszawa`` appears in 25 sequences and ``Warsaw`` in additional 37 (some may overlap, I haven't checked).

But which city in Poland has 26 hits?
